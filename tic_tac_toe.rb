# Pseudo-Code:

# create TicTacToe class
  # initialize a board.. so that on creation of new instance of game a board is created
# create a game board
  # board is 3x3 nested array numbered 1-9
# //draw the tic tac toe boxes - 3 x 3 boxes.
# //have player1 input a number..
#   //So X will appear inplace of number player enters.
#     //after x appears, check for a win..
        # if no win, keep playing, pcs turn, if 3 in a row, then end game.
#       //a win is 3 in a row diagonal,
# //have pc input an O
#   //the pc move will place an O in a random spot that is empty.
#     //so first check if spot is empty , if so place o, if not try another random spot on board.

# in this game.. create a board
# in this game.. see if theres a vertical win, horizontal win, diagonal win.
# in this game.. type a number to replace it with an X and check for 3 x's win.
